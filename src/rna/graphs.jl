    SimpleGraph(R::AbstractRecurrenceMatrix)

Create a recurrent network as a `SimpleGraph`, from the symmetric recurrence matrix `R`.
That matrix is typically the result of calculating a [`RecurrenceMatrix`](@ref)
or a [`JointRecurrenceMatrix`](@ref).

The recurrence structure of `R` is interpreted as the adjacency matrix of an
undirected complex network, where two different vertices are connected if they are
neighbors in the embedded phase space, i.e.

```math
A_{i,j} = R_{i,j} - \\delta_{i,j}
```

Following this definition, diagonal points of `R` are ommited, i.e.
the graph does not contain self-connected nodes.

See the package [Graphs.jl](https://juliagraphs.org/Graphs.jl/stable/)
for further options to work with `SimpleGraph` objects, besides the functions
for Recurrence Network Analysis provided in this package.
